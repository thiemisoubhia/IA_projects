# ðŸ§  AI Image Processing Labs

This repository contains practical exercises and code samples developed during Artificial Intelligence classes, focused primarily on **image processing using Python** libraries such as `OpenCV`, `NumPy`, and `Matplotlib`.

## About the Project

These hands-on labs were created to explore how AI and computer vision techniques can be used to read, analyze, and manipulate digital images. Topics covered include:

- Reading and displaying images
- RGB and grayscale transformations
- Understanding image shapes and pixel structures
- Image resizing and visualization
- Manipulating individual pixels
- Creating arrays and visual patterns
- Grayscale and binary visualizations
- Plotting multiple images in subplots
- Interactive challenges with array designs

## Sample Code

Hereâ€™s a quick preview of what youâ€™ll find inside:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
